# Assignment 1

The program implements the Subdivision curves lab assignment for Advanced Computer Graphics. There were 2 main assignments:

1. Implement a general curve subdivison algorithm.
The implementation is done using the Eigen library since it includes matrix multiplication. The implementation itself is identical to the lecture slides.
A working example is shown in "Images/smoothCurve.png"

2. Visualise the curvature
I visulaised the curvature using colour. When enabled the blue parts show the areas with a high curvature. An example is shown in "Images/showCurvature.png".
